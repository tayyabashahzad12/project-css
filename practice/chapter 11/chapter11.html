    <h2>The Composition of Seawater</h2>
    <p>Alomost everything can be find in seawater.This include dissolved materials from earth crusl
        as well as materials released from organism.The most important componenets of seawater that
        influence life forms are salinity ,temprature,dissolved gasses(mostly oxygen and
         carbon dioxide),nutreiets,and pH.These elements vary in composition as well as their
         influence on marine life.
